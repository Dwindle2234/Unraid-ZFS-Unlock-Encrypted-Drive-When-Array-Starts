# Unraid-ZFS-Unlock-Encrypted-Drive-When-Array-Starts
Instructions and simple script that will unlock your encrypted ZFS shares by pulling a keyfile via SSH from another device. No human interaction needed

# ZFS Automatically Unlocking Encrypted Shares
Principle
---------

Principle is that the password file (the key to unlocking datasets) sits (in my case) on a local pfSense/Netgate device.  Any local SSH device would be suitable

When unRaid starts up the password file is pulled onto the transiant /root folder by a script

If the file exists then the drive is mounted

If unRaid server is stolen then there is should be no access to Netgate and hence drives remain encrypted

Script Setup
-----

To enable the script to run on UnRaid install plugin ```NERDTOOLS``` and enable ```SSHPASS```. This enables us to SSH into NETGATE within a script without user interaction.

Edit in this [script](UnraidScript.txt) using the User\_Scripts plugin. Set the script to run when 'array starts up'

On NETGATE device use add-on **FILER** to create a file in a user's (SSH\_USER) home folder.  The file should be plain text and contains a password - call the file ```unraidpass.txt```.Â This user should have access for SSHing only (effectively ADMIN rights - but not advised to expose port 22 publically!).

Also enable SSH on the pfSense - Sytem/Advanced/Secure Shell. Leave the other options as default

Creating New Encrypted DataSets
---------------------------

```text-x-sh
zfs create -o encryption=on -o keylocation=file:///root/unraidpass.txt -o keyformat=passphrase disk1/SHARE-NAME
```

Be sure to create on as many disks as required - and **set the share to only use those disk**

This command lists the result

```text-x-sh
zfs get keylocation disk1/SHARE-NAME
```

You can 'lock' then 'unnlock' using the GUI (ZFS MASTER plugin) without needed the password (provided you haven't deleted it from /root)

Copying Files Over from existing unencrypted share
------------------

Suggest existing share is renamed, new dataset created then rsyc the files over

```text-x-sh
rsync -av --stats --progress /mnt/user/general/ /mnt/user/general
```
NOTE the extra slash on the source!


Changing an Existing Encrypted Share to Use the Password File
-------------------------------------------------------------

```text-x-sh
zfs change-key -o keylocation=file:///root/unraidpass.txt -o keyformat=passphrase disk1/SHARE-NAME
```

This doesn't change the 'master' ZFS password so the drive won't be recrypted with this command
